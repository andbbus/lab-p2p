---

## Session Format

Each session includes (roughly):
- **20 minutes:** Concept introduction and theory
- **60 minutes:** Hands-on practical activity
- **10 minutes:** Peer sharing and next steps
- **Take-home assignment** building toward final portfolio

---

## Who Should Join?

- Students preparing for their thesis or research project
- Anyone interested in reproducible, impactful data science workflows
- Perfect for Economics & Development students (but open to all)

---

## Prerequisites

- Basic familiarity with R – self study materials will be provided
- Laptop for hands-on exercises – eventually we could think of booking lab room

---

## Satisfactory metrics

**Primary Goals:**
- 12-15 enrolled participants (manageable cohort size)
- 80%+ retention rate through all 5 sessions
- 6 complete portfolios submitted at showcase

**Learning Outcomes:**
- All participants complete final showcase presentation
- Active community engagement via Discord
- Skills immediately applicable to thesis work
